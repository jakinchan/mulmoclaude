/**
 * Resolve the staging-skill slug from a `Write` tool call's `file_path`,
 * or `null` when the path is not a write to
 * `<workspace>/data/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`.
 *
 * Why TWO workspace roots are accepted:
 *   - **Docker off**: the agent runs on the host, so its absolute (or
 *     cwd-relative) `file_path` resolves under `hostWorkspaceRoot`.
 *   - **Docker on**: the agent runs INSIDE the sandbox, where the same
 *     workspace is bind-mounted at `CONTAINER_WORKSPACE_PATH`
 *     (`/home/node/mulmoclaude`). Its `file_path` is therefore
 *     `/home/node/mulmoclaude/data/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` — the SAME
 *     staging write under a DIFFERENT absolute root.
 *
 * The previous host-only `candidate === expectedPath` check silently
 * dropped the sandbox path (`/home/node/…` ≠ `/Users/…`), so L-31
 * failed under Docker even though the agent wrote SKILL.md to the
 * correct staging dir. Accepting either root fixes that while still
 * rejecting a write that lands outside both known workspace roots
 * (the false-positive guard the host-only check was originally for).
 *
 * Separators: only NATIVE forward-slash paths are matched as hits.
 * The Claude SDK serialises `file_path` with the agent host's
 * separator and this suite only ever runs the agent on Linux (Docker
 * sandbox) or macOS, so `/` is the sole form seen in practice. The
 * regex's `[/\\]` tolerance lets a backslash-form path match the
 * shape, but `path.resolve` on a POSIX host keeps the backslashes
 * literal so it won't equal either expected root — i.e. backslash
 * paths deliberately fall through to `null` (pinned by a unit test)
 * rather than being silently normalised for a Windows agent we never
 * run.
