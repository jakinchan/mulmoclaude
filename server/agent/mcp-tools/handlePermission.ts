// Permission-prompt-tool handler — wired via the Claude CLI's
// `--permission-prompt-tool mcp__mulmoclaude__handlePermission`
// flag in `buildCliArgs`. Whenever a built-in CLI tool's own
// `checkPermissions()` returns `behavior: "ask"` (i.e. it wants
// to gate on the user), the CLI calls this tool instead of
// surfacing an interactive prompt — which is what we need
// because MulmoClaude drives the CLI in headless stream-json
// mode with no TTY for the user to answer on.
//
// The CLI expects a JSON-encoded permission decision wrapped in
// a single MCP text block. We return the decision as a string;
// the MCP bridge in `mcp-server.ts` already wraps tool-handler
// strings as `{type:"text", text:<str>}`, which matches the
// CLI's expected shape.
//
// Decision shape (per the Claude Code 2.1.x CLI):
//   { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: <object> }
//   { behavior: "deny",  message: <string> }
//
// Current policy:
//   - `AskUserQuestion` is denied with a presentForm-redirect
//     message. The CLI's built-in AskUserQuestion has no UI
//     surface here — without this handler the CLI would echo
//     the literal permission message `"Answer questions?"`
//     back to the LLM as the tool result, which the model
//     misreads as "the user skipped the question". See #1499.
//   - **Every other ask-mode permission check is denied** with
//     a "no headless consent path" message. Auto-allowing them
//     would silently bypass the per-call consent the CLI tool
//     intentionally requested (Codex security review on PR
//     #1560: "removes per-call consent semantics for tools
//     that intentionally escalate to behavior:'ask'"). The
//     deny message tells the LLM the tool needs explicit user
//     approval that isn't available in this surface, so the
//     model picks a non-ask alternative (Read instead of a
//     Bash needing approval, etc.) or asks the user to redo
//     the request more concretely. The role's `--allowedTools`
//     remains the authoritative allow gate; this handler is
//     ONLY for ask-mode hooks.
