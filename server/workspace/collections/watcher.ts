// Filesystem watchers that drive collection-completion bell
// notifications. One `fs.watch` per discovered collection's `dataDir`,
// fanned out from a single boot call + a 30-second re-discovery
// interval that catches newly-created / deleted collections (there is
// no in-process "collections changed" event broadcast).
//
// Why a watcher, not just route hooks: the canonical pattern for
// collection-skills (see `helps/collection-skills.md`) has the agent
// Write records directly with the Write tool — that path never hits
// the REST API, so a route-level hook would miss most of the traffic
// the user actually generates. The watcher catches every mutation
// regardless of who wrote the file.
//
// All decisions live in `notifications.ts`; this module is pure
// plumbing: discover, mkdir, fs.watch, debounce-not-yet, forward
// events into the reconciler. Every reconcile call is idempotent so
// fs.watch's well-known quirks (`rename` vs `change`, atomic-write
// coalescence, filename === null on some platforms) don't need
// special handling — re-deriving state from the file on every event
// is the contract.
