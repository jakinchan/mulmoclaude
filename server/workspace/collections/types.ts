// Schema-driven collection types. A "collection" is a skill (under
// .claude/skills/<slug>/) that also ships a sibling `schema.json`.
// The host's <CollectionView> reads the schema + records and renders
// a table/form; Claude reads SKILL.md and CRUDs the records as JSON
// files.
//
// Field types for v0 — keep this list narrow and grow it only when a
// real collection needs the new type. v0 supports flat records only;
// nested tables / cross-collection refs / derived fields / actions are
// deferred to follow-ups (see plans/done/feat-skill-driven-apps.md and
// plans/done/feat-skill-driven-apps-worklog.md — historical names predate
// the rename).
