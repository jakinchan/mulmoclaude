// Bundled external-skill suggestions surfaced by
// `GET /api/skills/external/suggestions` (#1383 / #1335 PR-C).
//
// These are hand-curated repos we recommend to new users. The list
// ships in the launcher binary — there's no workspace-side state to
// migrate when entries change across releases. Users discover them
// through the "+ Add skill repository" modal (UI lands in PR-C2).
//
// Adding an entry here is a deliberate editorial act: each new repo
// expands what new users see by default. Stay conservative — verify
// the repo's license is permissive, the skill quality is high, and
// the repo is actively maintained.
