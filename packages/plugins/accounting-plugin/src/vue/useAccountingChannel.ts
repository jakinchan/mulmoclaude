// Returns a `version` ref that bumps every time the server publishes a
// change for the given bookId — addEntries, voidEntry,
// setOpeningBalances, upsertAccount, snapshot rebuild completion. View
// components watch `version` to drive `refetch` calls.
//
// `bookId` is reactive: switching the active book in BookSwitcher
// flips it; the composable unsubscribes from the old channel and
// subscribes to the new one.
//
// `onPayload` is an optional fine-grained hook for callers that want to
// inspect the event kind (e.g. show a "rebuilding…" indicator on
// `kind: "snapshots-rebuilding"`).
//
// The raw pub/sub transport is host-injected via `hostSubscribe`
// (see hostContext.ts) — the channel NAMES come from this package's
// own `./shared` so publisher and subscriber stay in lockstep.
