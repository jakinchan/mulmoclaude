# @mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin

Double-entry accounting plugin for MulmoClaude and MulmoTerminal. Three surfaces: ./shared (isomorphic enums/meta, browser-safe), ./vue (chat View/Preview + canvas app), ./server (createAccountingRouter — the workspace-file-backed backend, wired via dependency injection so it pulls zero host-only infra).

A plugin for [MulmoClaude](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude) and [MulmoTerminal](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal) — loaded by the host, not run standalone.

## Host wiring

A single-workspace host (MulmoClaude) wires three calls once at boot:

```ts
configureAccountingServer({ workspaceRoot, logger });
initAccountingEventPublisher(pubsub);
app.use(createAccountingRouter());
```

A host that serves one root per project directory (MulmoTerminal) wires the same three
differently:

```ts
configureAccountingServer({
  workspaceRoot: null,                    // explicit-root mode: a forgotten root throws
  logger,
  channelScopeForRoot: (root) => projectIdForRoot(root), // opaque id, or null for the default root
});
app.use(createAccountingRouter({ resolveWorkspaceRoot: (req) => rootForRequest(req) }));
configureAccountingHost({ apiCall, subscribe, localeTag, projectScope });  // the Vue surface
```

Both are opt-in and default to today's behaviour. The invariants behind them:

1. **A bookId is unique within a root and nowhere else.** Anything keyed by bookId alone —
   a channel, a rebuild queue, a card — is a cross-project collision waiting to happen.
2. **`workspaceRoot: null` is the safety net.** With N roots, a forgotten root is not a
   crash but a silent read or write against the wrong project; explicit-root mode turns it
   into a clear throw.
3. **A project is named by an opaque id, never a path.** Channel names and card envelopes
   reach the browser; an absolute root there publishes the user's home directory.
4. **The model never picks a project.** `manageAccounting`'s schema has no project
   parameter (pinned by a test), and this package never resolves one off a request body —
   only the host's own `resolveWorkspaceRoot` does.

## Dev loop

```bash
yarn workspace @mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin run build
yarn workspace @mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin run test
