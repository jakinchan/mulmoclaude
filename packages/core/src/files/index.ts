// plugins: atomic file I/O — tmp-write + rename, with the Windows retry loop —
// lives in exactly one place (#2399), and so does the realpath-based
// path-containment check (#2461). Internal-only helpers (isTransientRenameError,
// renameWithWindowsRetry) stay off this barrel and are imported from ./atomic by tests.
